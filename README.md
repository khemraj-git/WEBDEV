# My Web Development Projects

This repository showcases my web development projects, primarily built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.




## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (Currently focused on basic functionality; future projects will explore more advanced JavaScript concepts.)

## Future Plans

I plan to expand this repository by incorporating projects that utilize more advanced JavaScript techniques. This includes:

* Developing interactive web applications.
* Working with APIs to fetch and display data.
* Implementing dynamic user interfaces.
* Adding projects using frameworks and libraries.
